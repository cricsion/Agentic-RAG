It‚Äôs widely used across various industries for tasks such as recommendation engines, social network analysis, fraud detection, network and IT operations, and more. In this beginner‚Äôs guide, we‚Äôll explore the fundamental concepts of Neo4j and how to get started with it
What is a Graph Database?
Before diving into Neo4j, let‚Äôs understand the basics of graph databases. Unlike traditional relational databases that store data in tables, graph databases organize data in nodes, relationships, and properties. This structure closely resembles real-world relationships, making graph databases ideal for scenarios where relationships between data points are essential.
In a graph database:
- Nodes: Represent entities such as people, products, places, etc.
- Relationships: Define connections between nodes, indicating how entities are related.
- Properties: Store attributes or metadata associated with nodes or relationships.
Key Features of Neo4j:
- Native Graph Database: Neo4j is a native graph database, meaning it‚Äôs optimized for storing and querying graph data structures efficiently.
- ACID Compliance: Neo4j ensures data integrity and reliability by adhering to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which are crucial for transactional integrity.
- Cypher Query Language: Cypher is a powerful and intuitive query language specifically designed for graph databases. It allows users to express complex graph patterns in a concise and readable syntax.
- Scalability: Neo4j can scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate growing datasets and high query loads. It supports clustering and sharding for distributed deployments.

- Flexibility: With its schema-optional nature, Neo4j allows for flexible data modeling, enabling users to evolve their data models iteratively as requirements change.
- Rich Visualization Tools: Neo4j offers built-in and third-party visualization tools that help users explore and understand complex graph structures visually.
Key Concepts in Neo4j:
- Labels: Labels in Neo4j categorize nodes into groups based on their properties or roles within the database schema. They provide a way to organize and group nodes with similar characteristics.
- Properties: Properties are key-value pairs associated with nodes and relationships in Neo4j. They provide additional information about the entities and connections represented in the graph.
- Cypher Query Language: Cypher is a declarative query language specifically designed for Neo4j. It allows users to express graph patterns and perform operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data in the graph.
Getting Started with Neo4j:
- Installation: Visit the Neo4j website (neo4j.com) and download the appropriate installation package for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.
- Launch Neo4j: Once installed, start the Neo4j server. You can usually do this by running a command or clicking on an executable file, depending on your operating system.
3. Access Neo4j Browser: Neo4j Browser is a web-based tool for interacting with Neo4j databases. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Neo4j (typically http://localhost:7474).
3. Create a New Project:
Once you‚Äôre logged in to the Neo4j, you‚Äôll be presented with the startup screen. Click on ‚ÄúCreate Project‚Äù to initiate the process of creating a new graph database project.
In the project creation dialog, you‚Äôll be prompted to specify the name of your new project. Enter ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù as the project name to indicate that this database will be used to manage user data and enter a password.
After entering the project name and password, review the settings to ensure everything is configured as desired. Once you‚Äôre satisfied, click on the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button to create the ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù graph database project.
Creating Nodes and Relationships:
Let‚Äôs begin by creating nodes to represent individuals named John and Sally, along with a relationship indicating that John is a friend of Sally since a specific date.
Syntax:
The Cypher query CREATE ()-[]->()
introduces the basic syntax for creating nodes and relationships in Neo4j. Let's break down each component of this query:
- CREATE: This keyword indicates that we want to create new elements in the graph database.
- (): The empty parentheses
()
denote a node creation pattern. When used without specifying any labels or properties inside the parentheses, it creates a new anonymous node with no labels or properties. - -[]->: This segment represents a relationship creation pattern. The dash
-
indicates a relationship, and the square brackets[]
represent the absence of any properties associated with the relationship. The arrow->
specifies the direction of the relationship, indicating that it points from the source node to the target node.
Let‚Äôs begin by creating nodes to represent individuals named John and Sally, along with a relationship indicating that John is a friend of Sally since a specific date.
CREATE (:Person {name:'John', age:27})-[:FRIEND_OF {since:'2013-01-09'}]->(:Person {name: 'Sally', age:32})
In this Cypher query:
- We use the
CREATE
clause to create two nodes labeled asPerson
, each with propertiesname
andage
. - A relationship labeled
FRIEND_OF
is established between the nodes representing John and Sally, with asince
property specifying the start date of their friendship.
Querying Created Data:
After creating the nodes and relationship, several Cypher queries are performed to retrieve and manipulate the data:
- Querying a Single Node:
MATCH (j:Person {name:'John'})
RETURN j
In this query:
- We use the
MATCH
clause to find a node labeled asPerson
with the name 'John'. - The node is assigned the variable
j
, and we return the node along with its properties.
Output:
2. Retrieve Relationships:
MATCH (j:Person {name:'John'})-[f:FRIEND_OF]->(p)
RETURN j, f, p
Here:
- We match the node representing John and traverse outgoing relationships labeled
FRIEND_OF
to find connected nodes. - The relationship is assigned the variable
f
, and the connected node (representing Sally) is assigned the variablep
. - We return John, the relationship, and Sally to view the friendship details.
Creating a New Relationship:
MATCH (j:Person {name: 'John'}), (s:Person {name: 'Sally'})
CREATE (s)-[:FRIEND_OF {since:'2013‚Äì01‚Äì09'}]->(j)
This query establishes a new relationship between John and Sally, indicating that Sally is a friend of John since a specific date.
Now Let‚Äôs try Neo4j in Java:
Step 1: Set up Neo4j Java Driver
First, make sure you have the Neo4j Java Driver added to your project dependencies. You can do this by adding the appropriate dependency to your pom.xml
if you're using Maven, or build.gradle
if you're using Gradle.
For Maven:
<dependency>
<groupId>org.neo4j.driver</groupId>
<artifactId>neo4j-java-driver</artifactId>
<version>4.3.5</version> <!-- Or the latest version -->
</dependency>
For Gradle:
implementation 'org.neo4j.driver:neo4j-java-driver:4.3.5' // Or the latest version
Step 2: Write Java Code to Create Nodes and Relationships:
Now, let‚Äôs write Java code to achieve the node and relationship creation:
import org.neo4j.driver.*;
import static org.neo4j.driver.Values.parameters;
public class Neo4jExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Create a Neo4j driver instance
try (Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("username", "password"))) {
// Create a session to interact with the database
try (Session session = driver.session(SessionConfig.forDatabase("databaseName"))) {
// Cypher query to create nodes and relationships
String query = "CREATE (:Person {name: $johnName, age: $johnAge})-[:FRIEND_OF {since: $sinceDate}]->(:Person {name: $sallyName, age: $sallyAge})";
// Parameters for the query
Value params = parameters("johnName", "John", "johnAge", 27, "sinceDate", "2013-01-09", "sallyName", "Sally", "sallyAge", 32);
// Execute the query
session.run(query, params);
System.out.println("Nodes and relationship created successfully.");
}
} catch (Exception e) {
System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
}
}
Replace "bolt://localhost:7687"
, "username"
, "password"
, and "databaseName"
with your Neo4j server URI, username, password, and the name of your database, respectively.

Content:Neo4j for Beginners: An In-Depth Introduction with Java Examples
Neo4j is a graph database management system designed to efficiently store, manage, and query graph data structures. It‚Äôs widely used across various industries for tasks such as recommendation engines, social network analysis, fraud detection, network and IT operations, and more. In this beginner‚Äôs guide, we‚Äôll explore the fundamental concepts of Neo4j and how to get started with it
What is a Graph Database?
Before diving into Neo4j, let‚Äôs understand the basics of graph databases. Unlike traditional relational databases that store data in tables, graph databases organize data in nodes, relationships, and properties. This structure closely resembles real-world relationships, making graph databases ideal for scenarios where relationships between data points are essential.
In a graph database:
- Nodes: Represent entities such as people, products, places, etc.
- Relationships: Define connections between nodes, indicating how entities are related.
- Properties: Store attributes or metadata associated with nodes or relationships.
Key Features of Neo4j:
- Native Graph Database: Neo4j is a native graph database, meaning it‚Äôs optimized for storing and querying graph data structures efficiently.
- ACID Compliance: Neo4j ensures data integrity and reliability by adhering to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which are crucial for transactional integrity.
- Cypher Query Language: Cypher is a powerful and intuitive query language specifically designed for graph databases. It allows users to express complex graph patterns in a concise and readable syntax.
- Scalability: Neo4j can scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate growing datasets and high query loads. It supports clustering and sharding for distributed deployments.

- Flexibility: With its schema-optional nature, Neo4j allows for flexible data modeling, enabling users to evolve their data models iteratively as requirements change.
- Rich Visualization Tools: Neo4j offers built-in and third-party visualization tools that help users explore and understand complex graph structures visually.
Key Concepts in Neo4j:
- Labels: Labels in Neo4j categorize nodes into groups based on their properties or roles within the database schema. They provide a way to organize and group nodes with similar characteristics.
- Properties: Properties are key-value pairs associated with nodes and relationships in Neo4j. They provide additional information about the entities and connections represented in the graph.
- Cypher Query Language: Cypher is a declarative query language specifically designed for Neo4j. It allows users to express graph patterns and perform operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data in the graph.
Getting Started with Neo4j:
- Installation: Visit the Neo4j website (neo4j.com) and download the appropriate installation package for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.
- Launch Neo4j: Once installed, start the Neo4j server. You can usually do this by running a command or clicking on an executable file, depending on your operating system.
3. Access Neo4j Browser: Neo4j Browser is a web-based tool for interacting with Neo4j databases. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Neo4j (typically http://localhost:7474).
3. Create a New Project:
Once you‚Äôre logged in to the Neo4j, you‚Äôll be presented with the startup screen. Click on ‚ÄúCreate Project‚Äù to initiate the process of creating a new graph database project.
In the project creation dialog, you‚Äôll be prompted to specify the name of your new project. Enter ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù as the project name to indicate that this database will be used to manage user data and enter a password.
After entering the project name and password, review the settings to ensure everything is configured as desired. Once you‚Äôre satisfied, click on the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button to create the ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù graph database project.
Creating Nodes and Relationships:
Let‚Äôs begin by creating nodes to represent individuals named John and Sally, along with a relationship indicating that John is a friend of Sally since a specific date.
Syntax:
The Cypher query CREATE ()-[]->()
introduces the basic syntax for creating nodes and relationships in Neo4j. Let's break down each component of this query:
- CREATE: This keyword indicates that we want to create new elements in the graph database.
- (): The empty parentheses
()
denote a node creation pattern. When used without specifying any labels or properties inside the parentheses, it creates a new anonymous node with no labels or properties. - -[]->: This segment represents a relationship creation pattern. The dash
-
indicates a relationship, and the square brackets[]
represent the absence of any properties associated with the relationship. The arrow->
specifies the direction of the relationship, indicating that it points from the source node to the target node.
Let‚Äôs begin by creating nodes to represent individuals named John and Sally, along with a relationship indicating that John is a friend of Sally since a specific date.
CREATE (:Person {name:'John', age:27})-[:FRIEND_OF {since:'2013-01-09'}]->(:Person {name: 'Sally', age:32})
In this Cypher query:
- We use the
CREATE
clause to create two nodes labeled asPerson
, each with propertiesname
andage
. - A relationship labeled
FRIEND_OF
is established between the nodes representing John and Sally, with asince
property specifying the start date of their friendship.
Querying Created Data:
After creating the nodes and relationship, several Cypher queries are performed to retrieve and manipulate the data:
- Querying a Single Node:
MATCH (j:Person {name:'John'})
RETURN j
In this query:
- We use the
MATCH
clause to find a node labeled asPerson
with the name 'John'. - The node is assigned the variable
j
, and we return the node along with its properties.
Output:
2. Retrieve Relationships:
MATCH (j:Person {name:'John'})-[f:FRIEND_OF]->(p)
RETURN j, f, p
Here:
- We match the node representing John and traverse outgoing relationships labeled
FRIEND_OF
to find connected nodes. - The relationship is assigned the variable
f
, and the connected node (representing Sally) is assigned the variablep
. - We return John, the relationship, and Sally to view the friendship details.
Creating a New Relationship:
MATCH (j:Person {name: 'John'}), (s:Person {name: 'Sally'})
CREATE (s)-[:FRIEND_OF {since:'2013‚Äì01‚Äì09'}]->(j)
This query establishes a new relationship between John and Sally, indicating that Sally is a friend of John since a specific date.
Now Let‚Äôs try Neo4j in Java:
Step 1: Set up Neo4j Java Driver
First, make sure you have the Neo4j Java Driver added to your project dependencies. You can do this by adding the appropriate dependency to your pom.xml
if you're using Maven, or build.gradle
if you're using Gradle.
For Maven:
<dependency>
<groupId>org.neo4j.driver</groupId>
<artifactId>neo4j-java-driver</artifactId>
<version>4.3.5</version> <!-- Or the latest version -->
</dependency>
For Gradle:
implementation 'org.neo4j.driver:neo4j-java-driver:4.3.5' // Or the latest version
Step 2: Write Java Code to Create Nodes and Relationships:
Now, let‚Äôs write Java code to achieve the node and relationship creation:
import org.neo4j.driver.*;
import static org.neo4j.driver.Values.parameters;
public class Neo4jExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Create a Neo4j driver instance
try (Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("username", "password"))) {
// Create a session to interact with the database
try (Session session = driver.session(SessionConfig.forDatabase("databaseName"))) {
// Cypher query to create nodes and relationships
String query = "CREATE (:Person {name: $johnName, age: $johnAge})-[:FRIEND_OF {since: $sinceDate}]->(:Person {name: $sallyName, age: $sallyAge})";
// Parameters for the query
Value params = parameters("johnName", "John", "johnAge", 27, "sinceDate", "2013-01-09", "sallyName", "Sally", "sallyAge", 32);
// Execute the query
session.run(query, params);
System.out.println("Nodes and relationship created successfully.");
}
} catch (Exception e) {
System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
}
}
Replace "bolt://localhost:7687"
, "username"
, "password"
, and "databaseName"
with your Neo4j server URI, username, password, and the name of your database, respectively.
Conclusion:
Neo4j provides a powerful platform for managing graph data efficiently. By understanding the fundamental concepts of nodes, relationships, and properties, and leveraging the Neo4j Java Driver, you can build robust applications that harness the full potential of connected data.

What is Neo4j?
Neo4j is a powerful, high-performance, open-source graph database that enables the efficient management and querying of highly connected data. Unlike traditional relational databases, Neo4j uses graph structures to represent and store data, making it uniquely suited for applications involving complex relationships and dynamic, interconnected data. As the world‚Äôs leading graph database, Neo4j has become essential for organizations looking to leverage the power of graph technology for a variety of use cases.
Neo4j is a powerful and flexible graph database management system, designed to efficiently store and query highly interconnected data. Unlike traditional relational databases, which store data in tables, Neo4j uses a graph structure to represent and navigate relationships between data entities.
Neo4j structure
Neo4j stores and present the data in the form of graph not in tabular format or not in a Json format. Here the whole data is represented by nodes and there you can create a relationship between nodes. That means the whole database collection will look like a graph, that‚Äôs why it is making it unique from other database management system.
MS Access, SQL server all the relational database management system use tables to store or present the data with the help of column and row but Neo4j doesn‚Äôt use tables, row or columns like old school style to store or present the data.
What is a Graph Database?
A graph database uses graph theory to store, map, and query relationships. It consists of nodes, edges, and properties, where:
- Nodes represent entities such as people, businesses, or any data item.
- Edges (or relationships) connect nodes and illustrate how entities are related.
- Properties provide additional information about nodes and relationships.
This structure allows graph databases to model real-world scenarios more naturally and intuitively than traditional relational databases.
Features of Neo4J

Neo4j Tutorial: Using And Querying Graph Databases in Python
Data scientists start learning about SQL early. That‚Äôs understandable, given the ubiquity and high usefulness of tabular information. However, there are other successful database formats, like graph databases, to store connected data that don‚Äôt fit into a relational SQL database. In this tutorial, we will learn about Neo4j, a popular graph database management system that you can use to create, manage, and query graph databases in Python.
What Are Graph Databases?
Before talking about Neo4j, let‚Äôs take a moment to understand graph databases better. We have a full article explaining what graph databases are, so we‚Äôll summarize the key points here.
Graph databases are a type of NoSQL database (they don‚Äôt use SQL) designed for managing connected data. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, graph databases use graph structures that are made up of:
- Nodes (entities) such as people, places, concepts
- Edges (relationships) that connect different nodes like person LIVES IN a place, or a football player SCORED IN a match.
- Properties (attributes for nodes/edges) like the age of a person, or when in the match the goal was scored.
This structure makes graph databases ideal for handling interconnected data in fields and applications such as social networks, recommendations, fraud detection, etc., often outperforming relational DBs in terms of querying efficiency. Here is the structure of a sample graph database for a football dataset:
Even though this graph represents something fairly intuitive to humans, it can get pretty complicated if drawn on canvas. But, with Neo4j, traversing this graph will be as straightforward as writing simple SQL joins.
The graph has six nodes: Match, Team, Tournament, Player, Country, and City. The rectangles list the relationships that exist between nodes. There are also a few node and relationship properties:
- Match: date, home_score, away_score
- Team: name
- Player: name
- Tournament: name
- City: name
- Country: name
- SCORED_FOR, SCORED_IN: minute, own_goal, penalty
- HAD_SHOOTOUT: winner, first_shooter
This schema allows us to represent:
- All matches with their scores, dates, and locations
- Teams participating in each match (home and away)
- Players scoring goals, including details like the minute, own goals, and penalties
- Tournaments that matches are part of
- Cities and countries where matches are played
- Shootout information, including winners and first shooters (when available)
The schema captures the hierarchical nature of locations (City within Country) and the various relationships between entities (e.g., Teams playing Matches, Players scoring for Teams in Matches).
This structure allows for flexible querying, such as finding all matches between two teams, all goals scored by a player, or all matches in a specific tournament or location.
But let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. For starters, what is Neo4j and why use it?
What is Neo4j?
Neo4j, the leading name in the world of graph DB management, is known for its powerful features and versatility.
At its core, Neo4j uses native graph storage, which is highly optimized to carry out graph operations. Its efficiency in handling complex relations makes it outperform traditional databases for connected data. Neo4j‚Äôs scalability is truly impressive: it can handle billions of nodes and relationships with ease, making it suitable for both small projects and large enterprises.
Another key aspect of Neo4j is data integrity. It ensures full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, providing reliability and consistency in transactions.
Speaking of transactions, its query language, Cypher, offers a very intuitive and declarative syntax designed for graph patterns. For this reason, its syntax has been dubbed with the ‚ÄúASCII art‚Äù nickname. Cypher will be no problem to learn, especially if you are familiar with SQL.
With Cypher, it is easy to add new nodes, relationships, or properties without worrying about breaking existing queries or schema. It is adaptable to the rapidly changing requirements of modern development environments.
Neo4j has a vibrant ecosystem support. It has extensive documentation, comprehensive tools to visualize graphs, active community and integrations with other programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript.
Setting Up Neo4j and a Python Environment
Before we dive into working with Neo4j, we need to set up our environment. This section will guide you through creating a cloud instance to host Neo4j databases, setting up a Python environment, and establishing a connection between the two.
Not installing Neo4j
If you wish to work with local graph databases in Neo4j, then you would need to download and install it locally, along with its dependencies like Java. But in most cases, you will be interacting with an existing remote Neo4j database on some cloud environment.
For this reason, we won‚Äôt install Neo4j on our system. Instead, we will create a free database instance on Aura, Neo4j‚Äôs fully managed cloud service. Then, we will use the neo4j
Python client library to connect to this database and populate it with data.
Creating a Neo4j Aura DB instance
To host a free graph database on Aura DB, visit its product page and click on ‚ÄúGet Started for Free.‚Äù
Once you register, you will be presented with the available plans, and you should choose the free option. You will then be given a new instance with a username and password to connect to it:
Copy your password, username, and the connection URI.
Then, create a new working directory and a .env
file to store your credentials:
$ mkdir neo4j_tutorial; cd neo4j_tutorial
$ touch .env
Paste the following contents inside the file:
NEO4J_USERNAME="YOUR-NEO4J-USERNAME"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="YOUR-COPIED-NEO4J-PASSWORD"
NEO4J_CONNECTION_URI="YOUR-COPIED-NEO4J-URI"
Setting up the Python Environment
Now, we will install the neo4j Python client library in a new Conda environment:
$ conda create -n neo4j_tutorial python=3.9 -y
$ conda activate neo4j_tutorial
$ pip install ipykernel # To add the environment to Jupyter
$ ipython kernel install --user --name=neo4j_tutorial
$ pip install neo4j python-dotenv tqdm pandas
The commands also install ipykernel
library and use it to add the newly created Conda environment to Jupyter as a kernel. Then, we install the neo4j
Python client to interact with Neo4j databases and python-dotenv
to manage our Neo4j credentials securely.
Populating an AuraDB instance with football data
Data ingestion into a graph database is a complicated process that requires knowledge of Cypher fundamentals. Since we have yet to learn about Cypher basics, you will use a Python script that I have prepared for the article that will automatically ingest real-world historical football data. The script will use the credentials you have stored to connect to your AuraDB instance.
The football data comes from this Kaggle dataset on international football matches played between 1872 and 2024. The data is available in a CSV format, so the script breaks it down and converts it into graph format using Cypher and Neo4j. Towards the end of the article, when we are comfortable enough with these technologies, we will go through the script line-by-line so you can understand how to convert tabular information into a graph.
Here are the commands to run (ensure you have set up the AuraDB instance and stored your credentials in a .env
file in your working directory):
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BexTuychiev/medium_stories/refs/heads/master/2024/9_september/3_neo4j_python/ingest_football_data.py
$ python ingest_football_data.py
The script may take a few minutes to run, depending on your machine and Internet connection. However, once it finishes, your AuraDB instance must show over 64k nodes and 340k relationships.
Connecting to Neo4j From Python
Now, we are ready to connect to our Aura DB instance. First, we will read our credentials from the .env
file using dotenv
:
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
NEO4J_USERNAME = os.getenv("NEO4J_USERNAME")
NEO4J_PASSWORD = os.getenv("NEO4J_PASSWORD")
NEO4J_URI = os.getenv("NEO4J_URI")
Now, let‚Äôs establish a connection:
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
uri = NEO4J_URI
username = NEO4J_USERNAME
password = NEO4J_PASSWORD
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(username, password))
try:
driver.verify_connectivity()
print("Connection successful!")
except Exception as e:
print(f"Failed to connect to Neo4j: {e}")
Output:
Connection successful!
Here is an explanation of the code:
- We import
GraphDatabase
fromneo4j
to interact with Neo4j. - We use the previously loaded environment variables to set up our connection (
uri
,username
,password
). - We create a driver object using
GraphDatabase.driver()
, establishing a connection to our Neo4j database. - Under a
with
block, we use theverify_connectivity()
function to see if a connection is established. By default,verify_connectivity()
returns nothing if a connection is successful.
Once the tutorial finishes, call driver.close()
to terminate the connection and free up resources. Driver objects are expensive to create, so you should only create a single object for your application.
Cypher Query Language Essentials
Cypher‚Äôs syntax is designed to be intuitive and visually representative of graph structures. It relies on the following ASCII-art type of syntax:
(nodes)-[:CONNECT_TO]->(other_nodes)
Let‚Äôs break down the key components of this general query pattern:
1. Nodes
In a Cypher query, a keyword in parentheses signifies a node name. For example, (Player
) matches all Player nodes. Almost always, node names are referred to with aliases to make queries more readable, easier to write, and compact. You can add an alias to a node name by putting a colon before it: (m:Match
).
Inside the parentheses, you can specify one or more node properties for precise matching using dictionary-like syntax. For example:
// All tournament nodes that are FIFA World Cup
(t:Tournament {name: "FIFA World Cup"})
Node properties are written as-is, while the value you want them to have must be a string.
2. Relationships
Relationships connect nodes to each other, and they are wrapped with square brackets and arrows:
// Match nodes that are PART_OF some tournament
(m:Match)-[PART_OF]->(t:Tournament)
You can add aliases and properties to relationships as well:
// Matches that Brazil participated in a penalty shootout and was the first shooter
(p:Player) - [r:SCORED_FOR {minute: 90}] -> (t:Team)
Relationships are wrapped with arrows -[RELATIONSHIP]->
. Again, you can include aliases properties inside braces. For example:
// All players who scored an own goal
(p:Player)-[r:SCORED_IN {own_goal: True}]->(m:Match)
3. Clauses
Just like COUNT(*) FROM table_name
would not return anything without a SELECT
clause in SQL, (node) - [RELATIONSHIP] -> (node)
wouldn't fetch any results. So, just like in SQL, Cypher has different clauses to structure your query logic like SQL:
MATCH
: Pattern matching in the graphWHERE
: Filtering the resultsRETURN
: Specifying what to include in the result setCREATE
: Creating new nodes or relationshipsMERGE
: Creating unique nodes or relationshipsDELETE
: Removing nodes, relationships, or propertiesSET
: Updating labels and properties
Here‚Äôs a sample query that demonstrates these concepts:
MATCH (p:Player)-[s:SCORED_IN]->(m:Match)-[PART_OF]->(t:Tournament)
WHERE t.name = "FIFA World Cup" AND s.minute > 80 AND s.own_goal = True
RETURN p.name AS Player, m.date AS MatchDate, s.minute AS GoalMinute
ORDER BY s.minute DESC
LIMIT 5
This query finds all players who scored own goals in World Cup matches after the 80th-minute mark. It reads almost like SQL, but its SQL equivalent involves at least one JOIN.
Using Neo4j Python Driver to Analyze a Graph Database
Running queries with execute_query
The Neo4j Python driver is the official library that interacts with a Neo4j instance through Python applications. It verifies and communicates Cypher queries written in plain Python strings with a Neo4j server and retrieves the results in a unified format.
It all starts by creating a driver object with the GraphDatabase
class. From there, we can start sending queries using the execute_query
method.
For our first query, let‚Äôs ask an interesting question : Which team won the most World Cup matches?
# Return the team that won the most number of World Cup matches
query = """
MATCH (t:Team)-[:WON]->(m:Match)-[:PART_OF]->(:Tournament {name: "FIFA World Cup"})
RETURN t.name AS Team, COUNT(m) AS MatchesWon
ORDER BY MatchesWon DESC
LIMIT 1
"""
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(query, database_="neo4j")
First, let‚Äôs break down the query:
- The
MATCH
close defines the pattern we want: Team -> Wins -> Match -> Part of -> Tournament RETURN
is the equivalent of SQL'sSELECT
statement, where we can return the properties of returned nodes and relationships. In this clause, you can also use any supported aggregation function in Cypher. Above, we are usingCOUNT
.ORDER BY
clause works in the same manner as SQL's.LIMIT
is used to control the length of the returned records.
After we define the query as a multi-line string, we pass it to the execute_query()
method of the driver object and specify the database name (the default is neo4j
). The output always contains three objects:
records
: A list of Record objects, each representing a row in the result set. Each Record is a named tuple-like object where you can access fields by name or index.summary
: A ResultSummary object containing metadata about the query execution, such as query statistics and timing information.keys
: A list of strings representing the column names in the result set.
We will touch on the summary
object later because we are mostly interested in records
, which contain Record
objects. We can retrieve their info by calling their data()
method:
for record in records:
print(record.data())
Output:
{'Team': 'Brazil', 'MatchesWon': 76}
The result correctly shows that Brazil has won the most World Cup matches.
Passing query parameters
Our last query isn‚Äôt reusable, as it only finds the most successful team in World Cup history. What if we want to find the most successful team in Euro history?
This is where query parameters come in:
query = """
MATCH (t:Team)-[:WON]->(m:Match)-[:PART_OF]->(:Tournament {name: $tournament})
RETURN t.name AS Team, COUNT(m) AS MatchesWon
ORDER BY MatchesWon DESC
LIMIT $limit
"""
In this version of the query, we introduce two parameters using the $
sign:
tournament
limit
To pass values to the query parameters, we use keyword arguments inside execute_query
:
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(
query, database_="neo4j", tournament="UEFA Euro", limit=3,
)
for record in records:
print(record.data())
Output:
{'Team': 'Germany', 'MatchesWon': 30}
{'Team': 'Spain', 'MatchesWon': 28}
{'Team': 'Netherlands', 'MatchesWon': 23}
It is always recommended to use query parameters whenever you are thinking of ingesting changing values into your query. This best practice protects your queries from Cypher injections and enables Neo4j to cache them.
Writing to databases with CREATE and MERGE clauses
Writing new information to an existing database is similarly done with execute_query but by using a CREATE
clause in the query. For example, let's create a function that will add a new node type - team coaches:
def add_new_coach(driver, coach_name, team_name, start_date, end_date):
query = """
MATCH (t:Team {name: $team_name})
CREATE (c:Coach {name: $coach_name})
CREATE (c)-[r:COACHES]->(t)
SET r.start_date = $start_date
SET r.end_date = $end_date
"""
result = driver.execute_query(
query,
database_="neo4j",
coach_name=coach_name,
team_name=team_name,
start_date=start_date,
end_date=end_date
)
summary = result.summary
print(f"Added new coach: {coach_name} for existing team {team_name} starting from {start_date}")
print(f"Nodes created: {summary.counters.nodes_created}")
print(f"Relationships created: {summary.counters.relationships_created}")
The function add_new_coach
takes five parameters:
- driver: The Neo4j driver object used to connect to the database.
coach_name
: The name of the new coach to be added.team_name
: The name of the team the coach will be associated with.start_date
: The date when the coach starts coaching the team.end_date
: The date when the coach's tenure with the team ends.
The Cypher query in the function does the following:
- Matches an existing Team node with the given team name.
- Creates a new Coach node with the provided coach name.
- Creates a COACHES relationship between the Coach and Team nodes.
- Sets the
start_date
andend_date
properties on theCOACHES
relationship.
The query is executed using the execute_query
method, which takes the query string and a dictionary of parameters.
After execution, the function prints:
- A confirmation message with the coach and team names and start date.
- The number of nodes created (should be 1 for the new Coach node).
- The number of relationships created (should be 1 for the new
COACHES
relationship).
Let‚Äôs run it for one of the most successful coaches in international football history, Lionel Scaloni, who won three consecutive major international tournaments (World Cup and two Copa Americas):
from neo4j.time import DateTime
add_new_coach(
driver=driver,
coach_name="Lionel Scaloni",
team_name="Argentina",
start_date=DateTime(2018, 6, 1),
end_date=None
)
Output:
Added new coach: Lionel Scaloni for existing team Argentina starting from 2018-06-01T00:00:00.000000000
Nodes created: 1
Relationships created: 1
In the above snippet, we are using the DateTime
class from neo4j.time
module to pass a date correctly into our Cypher query. The module contains other useful temporal data types you may want to check out.
Apart from CREATE
, there is also the MERGE
clause for creating new nodes and relationships. Their key difference is:
CREATE
always creates new nodes/relationships, potentially leading to duplicates.MERGE
only creates nodes/relationships if they don't already exist.
For example, in our data ingestion script, as you will see later:
- We used
MERGE
for teams and players to avoid duplicates. - We used
CREATE
forSCORED_FOR
andSCORED_IN
relationships because a player can score multiple times in a single match. - These aren‚Äôt true duplicates as they have different properties (e.g., goal minute).
This approach ensures data integrity while allowing for multiple similar but distinct relationships.
Running your own transactions
When you run execute_query
, the driver creates a transaction under the hood. A transaction is a unit of work that is either executed in its entirety or rolled back as a failure. This means that when you are creating thousands of nodes or relationships in a single transaction (it is possible) and some error is encountered in the middle, the entire transaction fails without writing any new data to the graph.
To have finer control over each transaction, you need to create session objects. For example, let‚Äôs create a function to find the top K goal scores in a given tournament using a session object:
def top_goal_scorers(tx, tournament, limit):
query = """
MATCH (p:Player)-[s:SCORED_IN]->(m:Match)-[PART_OF]->(t:Tournament)
WHERE t.name = $tournament
RETURN p.name AS Player, COUNT(s) AS Goals
ORDER BY Goals DESC
LIMIT $limit
"""
result = tx.run(query, tournament=tournament, limit=limit)
return [record.data() for record in result]
First, we create top_goal_scorers
function that accepts three parameters, the most important one being the tx transaction object that will be obtained using a session object.
with driver.session() as session:
result = session.execute_read(top_goal_scorers, "FIFA World Cup", 5)
for record in result:
print(record)
Output:
{'Player': 'Miroslav Klose', 'Goals': 16}
{'Player': 'Ronaldo', 'Goals': 15}
{'Player': 'Gerd M√ºller', 'Goals': 14}
{'Player': 'Just Fontaine', 'Goals': 13}
{'Player': 'Lionel Messi', 'Goals': 13}
Then, under a context manager created with the session()
method, we use execute_read()
, passing the top_goal_scorers()
function, along with any parameters the query requires.
The output of execute_read
is a list of Record objects that correctly show the top 5 goal scorers in World Cup history, including names like Miroslav Klose, Ronaldo Nazario, and Lionel Messi.
The counterpart of execute_read()
for data ingestion is execute_write()
.
With that said, let‚Äôs now look at the ingestion script we used earlier to get a feel for how data ingestion works with the Neo4j Python driver.
Data Ingestion Using Neo4j Python Driver
The ingest_football_data.py file starts with import statements and loading the necessary CSV files:
import pandas as pd
import neo4j
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from tqdm import tqdm
import logging
# CSV file paths
results_csv_path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martj42/international_results/refs/heads/master/results.csv"
goalscorers_csv_path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martj42/international_results/refs/heads/master/goalscorers.csv"
shootouts_csv_path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martj42/international_results/refs/heads/master/shootouts.csv"
# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Loading data...")
# Load data
results_df = pd.read_csv(results_csv_path, parse_dates=["date"])
goalscorers_df = pd.read_csv(goalscorers_csv_path, parse_dates=["date"])
shootouts_df = pd.read_csv(shootouts_csv_path, parse_dates=["date"])
This code block also sets up a logger. The next few lines of code read my Neo4j credentials using dotenv
and creates a Driver object:
uri = os.getenv("NEO4J_URI")
user = os.getenv("NEO4J_USERNAME")
password = os.getenv("NEO4J_PASSWORD")
try:
driver = neo4j.GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))
print("Connected to Neo4j instance successfully!")
except Exception as e:
print(f"Failed to connect to Neo4j: {e}")
BATCH_SIZE = 5000
Since there are more than 48k matches in our database, we define a BATCH_SIZE
parameter to ingest data in smaller samples.
Then, we define a function called create_indexes
that accepts a session object:
def create_indexes(session):
indexes = [
"CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (t:Team) ON (t.name)",
"CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (m:Match) ON (m.id)",
"CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (p:Player) ON (p.name)",
"CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (t:Tournament) ON (t.name)",
"CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:City) ON (c.name)",
"CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:Country) ON (c.name)",
]
for index in indexes:
session.run(index)
print("Indexes created.")
Cypher indexes are database structures that improve query performance in Neo4j. They speed up the process of finding nodes or relationships based on specific properties. We need them for:
- Faster query execution
- Improved read performance on large datasets
- Efficient pattern matching
- Enforcing unique constraints
- Better scalability as the database grows
In our case, indexes on team names, match IDs, and player names will help our queries run faster when searching for specific entities or performing joins across different node types. It is a best practice to create such indexes for your own databases.
Next, we have the ingest_matches
function. It is large, so let's break it down block by block:
def ingest_matches(session, df):
query = """
UNWIND $batch AS row
MERGE (m:Match {id: row.id})
SET m.date = date(row.date), m.home_score = row.home_score, m.away_score = row.away_score, m.neutral = row.neutral
MERGE (home:Team {name: row.home_team})
MERGE (away:Team {name: row.away_team})
MERGE (t:Tournament {name: row.tournament})
MERGE (c:City {name: row.city})
MERGE (country:Country {name: row.country})
MERGE (home)-[:PLAYED_HOME]->(m)
MERGE (away)-[:PLAYED_AWAY]->(m)
MERGE (m)-[:PART_OF]->(t)
MERGE (m)-[:PLAYED_IN]->(c)
MERGE (c)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(country)
WITH m, home, away, row.home_score AS hs, row.away_score AS as
FOREACH(_ IN CASE WHEN hs > as THEN [1] ELSE [] END |
MERGE (home)-[:WON]->(m)
MERGE (away)-[:LOST]->(m)
)
FOREACH(_ IN CASE WHEN hs < as THEN [1] ELSE [] END |
MERGE (away)-[:WON]->(m)
MERGE (home)-[:LOST]->(m)
)
FOREACH(_ IN CASE WHEN hs = as THEN [1] ELSE [] END |
MERGE (home)-[:DREW]->(m)
MERGE (away)-[:DREW]->(m)
)
"""
...
The first thing you will notice is the UNWIND
keyword, which is used to process a batch of data. It takes the $batch
parameter (which will be our DataFrame rows) and iterates over each row, allowing us to create or update multiple nodes and relationships in a single transaction. This approach is more efficient than processing each row individually, especially for large datasets.
The rest of the query is familiar since it uses multiple MERGE
clauses. Then, we reach the WITH
clause, which uses FOREACH
constructs with IN CASE
statements. These are used to conditionally create relationships based on the match outcome. If the home team wins, it creates a 'WON' relationship for the home team and a 'LOST' relationship for the away team, and vice versa. In case of a draw, both teams get a 'DREW' relationship with the match.
The rest of the function divides the incoming DataFrame into matches and constructs the data that will be passed to the $batch
query parameter:
def ingest_matches(session, df):
query = """..."""
for i in tqdm(range(0, len(df), BATCH_SIZE), desc="Ingesting matches"):
batch = df.iloc[i : i + BATCH_SIZE]
data = []
for _, row in batch.iterrows():
match_data = {
"id": f"{row['date']}_{row['home_team']}_{row['away_team']}",
"date": row["date"].strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
"home_score": int(row["home_score"]),
"away_score": int(row["away_score"]),
"neutral": bool(row["neutral"]),
"home_team": row["home_team"],
"away_team": row["away_team"],
"tournament": row["tournament"],
"city": row["city"],
"country": row["country"],
}
data.append(match_data)
session.run(query, batch=data)
ingest_goals
and ingest_shootouts
functions use similar constructs. However, ingest_goals
have some additional error and missing value handling.
At the end of the script, we have the main()
function that executes all our ingestion functions with a session object:
def main():
with driver.session() as session:
create_indexes(session)
ingest_matches(session, results_df)
ingest_goals(session, goalscorers_df)
ingest_shootouts(session, shootouts_df)
print("Data ingestion completed!")
driver.close()
if __name__ == "__main__":
main()

Title:Neo4j : The Graph Database - GeeksforGeeks
Content:Neo4j : The Graph Database
Neo4j is the most famous database management system and it is also a NoSQL database system. Neo4j is different from Mysql or MongoDB it has its own features and it is designed to efficiently store and query highly interconnected data that‚Äôs makes it special compared to other Database Management System.
Neo4j is a cutting-edge database designed to handle and analyze connected data more efficiently than traditional databases. Instead of using tables, it uses graph structures to store and query data, making it ideal for applications with complex relationships. Neo4j is known for its high performance, scalability, and flexibility, and is used in various fields like social network analysis, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs. This article will explore Neo4j‚Äôs key features, benefits, and uses, showing how it transforms data management and helps uncover deeper insights
Table of Content
What is Neo4j?
Neo4j is a powerful, high-performance, open-source graph database that enables the efficient management and querying of highly connected data. Unlike traditional relational databases, Neo4j uses graph structures to represent and store data, making it uniquely suited for applications involving complex relationships and dynamic, interconnected data. As the world‚Äôs leading graph database, Neo4j has become essential for organizations looking to leverage the power of graph technology for a variety of use cases.
Neo4j is a powerful and flexible graph database management system, designed to efficiently store and query highly interconnected data. Unlike traditional relational databases, which store data in tables, Neo4j uses a graph structure to represent and navigate relationships between data entities.
Neo4j structure
Neo4j stores and present the data in the form of graph not in tabular format or not in a Json format. Here the whole data is represented by nodes and there you can create a relationship between nodes. That means the whole database collection will look like a graph, that‚Äôs why it is making it unique from other database management system.
MS Access, SQL server all the relational database management system use tables to store or present the data with the help of column and row but Neo4j doesn‚Äôt use tables, row or columns like old school style to store or present the data.
What is a Graph Database?
A graph database uses graph theory to store, map, and query relationships. It consists of nodes, edges, and properties, where:
- Nodes represent entities such as people, businesses, or any data item.
- Edges (or relationships) connect nodes and illustrate how entities are related.
- Properties provide additional information about nodes and relationships.
This structure allows graph databases to model real-world scenarios more naturally and intuitively than traditional relational databases.

Title:Congress averts government shutdown after Senate passes stopgap funding ...
Link:https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/politics/government-funding-bill-senate-shutdown/index.html
Content:Congress averted a government shutdown Friday just hours before the funding deadline, after the Senate approved a House-passed spending bill that exposed deep rifts within the Democratic Party.
The stopgap measure to fund the government into the fall now heads to the desk of President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.
Senate Democrats came under intense pressure to oppose the Trump-backed bill, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and others are now facing backlash after they helped to clear a path for its passage.
The rising tensions within the party spilled into public view as lawmakers raced toward a shutdown that would have had far-reaching consequences across the federal government ‚Äì highlighting the struggle Democrats face in attempting to counter Trump and the Republican monopoly on power in Washington.
Some 90 minutes before Senate Republicans staved off a shutdown on a nearly party-line vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine others crossed the aisle to advance it in a key procedural vote ‚Äì despite intensifying pressure from their caucus to sink it outright. The legislation, however, only required a simple majority in the chamber for final passage, and all but two in the group ultimately opposed it.
Schumer argued his party had only bad options when it came to shutting down the government ‚Äì possibly for months ‚Äì to challenge Trump, or accepting a GOP bill that Democrats have warned would cut spending to programs like veterans‚Äô health care or Washington, DC, firefighters and police.
‚ÄúI believe it is the best way to minimize the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,‚Äù Schumer argued in defense of his decision to clear a pathway for the bill‚Äôs passage.
‚ÄúClearly, this is a Hobson‚Äôs choice. The CR is a bad bill, but as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,‚Äù he continued.
Trump praised Schumer for announcing he would support the measure, telling reporters after the vote Friday: ‚ÄúI appreciate Senator Schumer, and I think he did the right thing, really. I‚Äôm very impressed by that.‚Äù
Outside of Schumer‚Äôs leadership team, many Senate Democrats as well as House Democrats seethed at the Democrat‚Äôs move, which they saw as a capitulation in the party‚Äôs first real leverage point in Trump‚Äôs second term.
The initial vote, while procedural, had been closely watched by Democrats across the country, who saw it as a test of their party leaders‚Äô willingness to fight Trump.
Ultimately, the Senate voted 54-46 to approve the stopgap bill to fund the government through September 30. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the party, voted in favor of the bill and just one Republican ‚Äì Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky ‚Äì opposed it.
‚ÄúOnce I had voted for cloture, it was an opportunity to pass the bill, and I thought it was more honest to vote for it,‚Äù Shaheen told CNN, adding: ‚ÄúI thought, much as I didn‚Äôt like the CR, I thought a government shutdown would be worse and would give Trump and Elon Musk and the DOGE operation more of an opportunity to fire people, to shut down agencies and to close the work of the government.‚Äù
After voting to pass the stopgap bill, the Senate approved a separate measure to allow Washington, DC, to maintain control over its funds after Democrats warned the Republican funding package would cut $1.1 billion of the city‚Äôs funding. The measure would next need to be passed by the House, where its fate is unclear.
At the urging of prominent Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, voters had been flooding senators‚Äô offices with calls urging them to block the bill and take on Trump for his dismantling of the federal government. Ultimately, many Democrats believe, Schumer failed that test.
The New York Democrat‚Äôs strategy has faced fierce blowback from all corners of the Democratic Party, including in his own chamber, though no senators have publicly said they would challenge his leadership over the move.
Earlier in the week, top House Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, led a fierce whip operation against the bill, ultimately losing just one of their members on the vote. But it was not enough to sink the bill, which passed the House Tuesday.
Jeffries would not answer Friday when asked whether he had lost confidence in Schumer, with whom he diverged on the funding issue.
‚ÄúNext question,‚Äù he told reporters.
Democrats contemplate path forward
Senate Democrats are now grappling with how to move forward as a caucus after the government funding bill split their party.
Schumer told CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper Friday evening that he ‚Äúalways knew there would be disagreements,‚Äù but maintained that a ‚Äúgovernment shutdown would be far worse‚Äù than voting for the GOP-led measure.
‚ÄúMy job as leader is to lead the party and if there‚Äôs going to be danger in the near future, to protect the party. And I‚Äôm proud I did it, I knew I did the right thing, and I knew there would be some disagreements. That‚Äôs how it always is,‚Äù he said.
Schumer also defended his leadership position, saying, ‚ÄúMy caucus and I are in sync.‚Äù
Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, would not say whether he thought the party needed a new leader, telling reporters: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a conversation for inside the caucus. I‚Äôm not going to debate that out here.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think that Leader Schumer has been very effective in a lot of battles, but we also need to ‚Äî these are new times, and we need to all come together.

At least 40 people in seven states have died amid the severe weather outbreak, officials said Sunday.
At least 12 deaths were reported in Missouri, the most of any state, officials said.
On Sunday morning, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said at least three people were killed in her state on Saturday.
"Yesterday's severe weather impacted most of Alabama," Ivey said in a statement. "Unfortunately, we have learned of the loss of at least two of our fellow Alabamians -- one life in Plantersville and one in Winterboro."
Ivey said 52 of Alabama's 67 counties reported damage from the severe weather outbreak and that a damage assessment was continuing.
"The sun has risen in Alabama, though," Ivey said. "We pray for those lives we lost, as well as those who were injured. And we pray for our first responders, emergency management officials, and linemen who are doing incredible work on the ground right now."
At least eight deaths were reported in Kansas; six people in Mississippi were killed; four people perished in Texas; three people died in Arkansas; and four people were killed in Oklahoma, officials said.

Title:Congress averts government shutdown after Senate passes stopgap funding ...

Content:Congress averted a government shutdown Friday just hours before the funding deadline, after the Senate approved a House-passed spending bill that exposed deep rifts within the Democratic Party.
The stopgap measure to fund the government into the fall now heads to the desk of President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.
Senate Democrats came under intense pressure to oppose the Trump-backed bill, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and others are now facing backlash after they helped to clear a path for its passage.
The rising tensions within the party spilled into public view as lawmakers raced toward a shutdown that would have had far-reaching consequences across the federal government ‚Äì highlighting the struggle Democrats face in attempting to counter Trump and the Republican monopoly on power in Washington.
Some 90 minutes before Senate Republicans staved off a shutdown on a nearly party-line vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine others crossed the aisle to advance it in a key procedural vote ‚Äì despite intensifying pressure from their caucus to sink it outright. The legislation, however, only required a simple majority in the chamber for final passage, and all but two in the group ultimately opposed it.
Schumer argued his party had only bad options when it came to shutting down the government ‚Äì possibly for months ‚Äì to challenge Trump, or accepting a GOP bill that Democrats have warned would cut spending to programs like veterans‚Äô health care or Washington, DC, firefighters and police.
‚ÄúI believe it is the best way to minimize the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,‚Äù Schumer argued in defense of his decision to clear a pathway for the bill‚Äôs passage.
‚ÄúClearly, this is a Hobson‚Äôs choice. The CR is a bad bill, but as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,‚Äù he continued.
Trump praised Schumer for announcing he would support the measure, telling reporters after the vote Friday: ‚ÄúI appreciate Senator Schumer, and I think he did the right thing, really. I‚Äôm very impressed by that.‚Äù
Outside of Schumer‚Äôs leadership team, many Senate Democrats as well as House Democrats seethed at the Democrat‚Äôs move, which they saw as a capitulation in the party‚Äôs first real leverage point in Trump‚Äôs second term.
The initial vote, while procedural, had been closely watched by Democrats across the country, who saw it as a test of their party leaders‚Äô willingness to fight Trump.
Ultimately, the Senate voted 54-46 to approve the stopgap bill to fund the government through September 30. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the party, voted in favor of the bill and just one Republican ‚Äì Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky ‚Äì opposed it.
‚ÄúOnce I had voted for cloture, it was an opportunity to pass the bill, and I thought it was more honest to vote for it,‚Äù Shaheen told CNN, adding: ‚ÄúI thought, much as I didn‚Äôt like the CR, I thought a government shutdown would be worse and would give Trump and Elon Musk and the DOGE operation more of an opportunity to fire people, to shut down agencies and to close the work of the government.‚Äù
After voting to pass the stopgap bill, the Senate approved a separate measure to allow Washington, DC, to maintain control over its funds after Democrats warned the Republican funding package would cut $1.1 billion of the city‚Äôs funding. The measure would next need to be passed by the House, where its fate is unclear.
At the urging of prominent Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, voters had been flooding senators‚Äô offices with calls urging them to block the bill and take on Trump for his dismantling of the federal government. Ultimately, many Democrats believe, Schumer failed that test.
The New York Democrat‚Äôs strategy has faced fierce blowback from all corners of the Democratic Party, including in his own chamber, though no senators have publicly said they would challenge his leadership over the move.
Earlier in the week, top House Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, led a fierce whip operation against the bill, ultimately losing just one of their members on the vote. But it was not enough to sink the bill, which passed the House Tuesday.
Jeffries would not answer Friday when asked whether he had lost confidence in Schumer, with whom he diverged on the funding issue.
‚ÄúNext question,‚Äù he told reporters.
Democrats contemplate path forward
Senate Democrats are now grappling with how to move forward as a caucus after the government funding bill split their party.
Schumer told CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper Friday evening that he ‚Äúalways knew there would be disagreements,‚Äù but maintained that a ‚Äúgovernment shutdown would be far worse‚Äù than voting for the GOP-led measure.
‚ÄúMy job as leader is to lead the party and if there‚Äôs going to be danger in the near future, to protect the party. And I‚Äôm proud I did it, I knew I did the right thing, and I knew there would be some disagreements. That‚Äôs how it always is,‚Äù he said.
Schumer also defended his leadership position, saying, ‚ÄúMy caucus and I are in sync.‚Äù
Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, would not say whether he thought the party needed a new leader, telling reporters: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a conversation for inside the caucus. I‚Äôm not going to debate that out here.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think that Leader Schumer has been very effective in a lot of battles, but we also need to ‚Äî these are new times, and we need to all come together. And so, you know, second guessing Leader Schumer out here isn‚Äôt going to accomplish the kind of community that we‚Äôre going to need to be able to stand up to the president. So, we‚Äôll have that conversation inside caucus,‚Äù the New Mexico Democrat added.
Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that he has ‚Äúfaith in Chuck Schumer,‚Äù but acknowledged that the caucus had a ‚Äúchoppy week.‚Äù

Title:Trump lauds latest hostage release, says US will support Israel's ...
Link:https://thehill.com/policy/international/5147352-donald-trump-israel-hamas-hostage-release/
Content:Trump lauds latest hostage release, says US will support Israel‚Äôs decision on ceasefire
President Trump on Saturday celebrated the latest hostage release, when Hamas freed the last living Israeli American from captivity in Gaza, but warned the Palestinian militant group that the U.S. will support Israel‚Äôs decision on whether the fragile ceasefire continues.
‚ÄúHamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape!‚Äù Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ‚ÄúThis differs from their statement last week that they would not release any Hostages.‚Äù
‚ÄúIsrael will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O‚ÄôCLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe United States will back the decision they make.‚Äù
Three more hostages were released in Khan Yunis in the latest exchange, including Israeli Argentinian Iair Horn, 46, Israeli American Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, and Russian-Israeli Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov. In return, Israel is set to free 369 Palestinian prisoners, including a number of those who served life sentences.
Saturday‚Äôs release marks the sixth complete exchange since the pause in fighting began on Jan. 19.
Hamas, a designated terrorist organization by the U.S., threatened to delay the release of Israeli hostages earlier this week, and accused the Jewish state of violating the terms of the fragile ceasefire. The group said Monday that the violations were ‚Äúdelaying the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, targeting them with shelling and gunfire in various areas of the Strip, and not allowing the entry of relief supplies in all their forms according to what was agreed upon.‚Äù
Trump then issued a warning to the group, pressing them to release the remaining hostages held in the Strip by noon local time or he would end the brittle ceasefire. He claimed at the time that ‚Äúall hell is going to break out‚Äù if they are not freed.
In line with the U.S. president, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also cautioned the militant group that the temporary truce in Gaza would be shattered and Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which he ordered to amass in and around the war-torn enclave, would restart their fight until Hamas is eviscerated.
‚ÄúThe decision I passed in the Cabinet unanimously is as follows: If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end, and the IDF will resume intense combat until Hamas is decisively defeated,‚Äù Netanyahu said Tuesday.
Hamas did confirm on Thursday that it would go ahead with freeing the three hostages. It is unclear if the rest of the captives held in Gaza will be released later Saturday.
Israel and Hamas are in the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire that is slated to last for six weeks. The terms of the second phase, where more Palestinian prisoners are meant to be freed, have not been brokered entirely.

What to know for following 2024 election coverage
CBS News projects former President Donald Trump will win the presidency, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris to become the 47th president of the United States.
A CBS News projection for Trump in Wisconsin put him over the finish line early Wednesday morning, after earlier projections for Trump winning the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Votes were still being counted in several other states.
Trump declared victory in a speech to supporters early Wednesday morning, alongside his family and running mate, Sen. JD Vance.
"I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president," Trump said at his election headquarters in Florida. "And every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family and for your future. Every single day, I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body."
At 78, Trump will be the oldest president ever to assume office.
Harris didn't speak at all on Election Night, forgoing her planned event at Howard University. She addressed not only supporters but also Howard University students on Wednesday afternoon, urging the emotional crowd "do not despair."
"This is not a time to throw up our hands," Harris said. "This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together."
Republicans also had success in some key Senate races and CBS News projects the GOP will gain control of the upper chamber. Control of the House remains undetermined, with votes still being counted in numerous races.
Some Harris backers pointing fingers at Biden for her loss
As Democrats pick up the pieces following President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory, some supporters of Vice President Harris are expressing frustration that President Biden waited until summer to step out of the race - despite longstanding voter concerns about his age and unease about post-pandemic inflation as well as the U.S.-Mexico border. They say the delay all but sealed his party's loss of the White House.
"The biggest onus of this loss is on President Biden," said Andrew Yang, who ran against Mr. Biden in 2020 for the Democratic nomination and endorsed Harris' unsuccessful run. "If he had stepped down in January instead of July, we may be in a very different place."
Mr. Biden will leave office after leading the U.S. out of the worst pandemic in a century, galvanizing international support for Ukraine in the aftermath of Russia's invasion and passing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that will impact communities for years to come.
But having run four years ago against Trump to "restore the soul of the country," Mr. Biden will make way after just one term for his immediate predecessor, who overcame two impeachments, a felony conviction and an insurrection launched by his supporters. Trump has vowed to radically reshape the federal government and roll back many of Mr. Biden's priorities.
"Maybe in 20 or 30 years, history will remember Biden for some of these achievements," said Thom Reilly, co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at Arizona State University. "But in the shorter term, I don't know he escapes the legacy of being the president who beat Donald Trump only to usher in another Donald Trump administration four years later."

Trump victory leaves NATO, Ukraine nervous
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump Wednesday, saying, "I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO" in the face of "a growing number of challenges globally," including "the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran."
Trump was a strong critic of the North Atlantic military alliance during his first term, accusing its other members of failing to pull their weight. Earlier this year he said the U.S. would not defend NATO members that don't meet defense spending targets. Trump wants European allies to boost their own military spending to rely less on U.S. deterrence, but some European leaders and diplomats have expressed fears that he fundamentally lacks commitment to NATO.
Rutte emphasized the positive, praising Trump for his work persuading member states to ramp up defense spending and saying NATO was now "stronger, larger, and more united."
The U.S. is by far Ukraine's biggest military backer as it battles Russian invasion, though the Biden administration resisted pressure from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to do even more. Zelenskyy, like Rutte, said he welcomed Trump's "peace through strength" approach.
"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer," Zelenskyy wrote on social media. "I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership."
No congratulations were forthcoming from Moscow, where President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, declared that Russia-U.S. relations were at the "lowest point in history."
Netanyahu speaks with Trump after congratulating him for a "huge victory"
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with President-elect Donald Trump Wednesday evening for about 20 minutes, according to Netanyahu's office, with the two discussing Israel's security. The conversation came after Netanyahu took to social media to congratulate Trump in the warmest of terms, calling Trump's win a "huge victory" and "history's greatest comeback."
That reaction was perhaps not surprising given strains in the relationship between Netanyahu and the Biden administration over the war in Gaza.
Trump was a staunch supporter of Israel during his first term. But Trump has repeatedly said during the campaign that Israel should finish the war. It's unclear what that will mean in concrete terms, but Netanyahu seems determined to keep fighting.
On Tuesday, Netanyahu fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, in part because of differences over the war's goals.
Schumer calls for bipartisanship as Democrats lose Senate majority
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats are committed to working with their Republican colleagues in the upper chamber after Democrats lost their majority in the next Congress.
"As I've said time and again, in both the majority and the minority, the only way to get things done in the Senate is through bipartisan legislation while maintaining our principles ‚Äî and the next two years will be no different," the New York Democrat said in a statement.
Melania Trump: "We will safeguard the heart of our republic"
Melania Trump, who rarely appeared on the campaign trail during the 2024 election, broke her silence on the results.
"We will safeguard the heart of our republic ‚Äì freedom," she wrote on social media. "I anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security.
American energy, skill, and initiative will bring together our best minds to propel our nation forward forevermore."
On Tuesday, she shared a photo of her 18-year-old son, Barron, voting for the first time.
Trump campaign says meeting with Biden "will take place shortly"
Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung confirmed that President Biden called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on the victory and invite him to the White House.
"President Trump looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call," Cheung said in a statement.
Biden calls Harris "a tremendous partner"
President Biden commended Vice President Kamala Harris after her concession speech, calling her "a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage and character."
"What America saw today was the Kamala Harris I know and deeply admire," the president said in a statement. "Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans."
Pence congratulates Trump after declining to endorse him
Former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he sends his "sincere congratulations" to Trump.
Pence, who was Trump's first vice president, said in March he "cannot in good conscience" endorse Trump. He said then that he was "pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years."
"We will continue to pray for all those in authority and urge every American to join us in praying for our incoming President, Vice President and elected officials at every level," Pence said Wednesday.
Obamas congratulate Trump and Vance
Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama congratulated President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance on their victory in a statement Wednesday afternoon.
"This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for, given our profound disagreements with the Republican ticket on a whole host of issues," the couple said. "But living in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power."
The statement acknowledged that inflation and other factors "created headwinds for democratic incumbents around the world, and last night showed that America is not immune."
"The good news is that these problems are solvable ‚Äì but only if we listen to each other, and only if we abide by the core constitutional principles and democratic norms that made this country great," they said.
CBS News characterizes control of House as lean Republican
CBS News has characterized control of the House as lean Republican. Republicans are expected to win at least 211 seats and Democrats are on track to win at least 203. A party needs to win 218 to secure the majority.
Harris acknowledges "many people feel we are entering a dark time," but says "I hope that is not the case"
Harris particularly encouraged young campaign workers and supporters, telling them it's going to be ok. Harris often said on the campaign trail, "When we fight, we win," but on Wednesday, Harris told her supporters that sometimes, that fight takes a long time.
"This is not a time to throw up our hands," she said. "This is a time to roll up our sleeves."
Harris spoke of an old adage ‚Äî only when it is dark enough can one see the stars.
"I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time. But for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is ‚Äî let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion stars. The light, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth, and service."
Harris walked off the stage with her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff.
Harris says she will help Trump's transition team and "engage in a peaceful transfer of power"
Harris said that in her conversation with President-elect Trump on Wednesday, she told Trump that she will help him and his team with their transition, "and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power."
"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results," Harris said. "That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it."
Still, Harris said, Americans owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution, conscience and God.
"My allegiance to all three is while I'm here to say, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign," she said.
Harris says the outcome of this election is "not what we wanted" but "my heart is full today"
The vice president took the stage at Howard University at 4:24 p.m. to her campaign theme song, "Freedom," by Beyonce. A throng of students and other supporters cheered her on. Chants of "Kamala, Kamala!" erupted as she greeted the crowd.
Harris thanked her supporters, volunteers, husband, family and election poll workers, saying her "heart is full today."
"So let me say my heart is full today," she said. "My heart is full today. Full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me. Full of love for our country. And full of resolve. The outcome of this election is not what we wanted. Not what we fought for. Not what we voted for. But hear me when I say ‚Äî hear me when I say ‚Äî the light of America's promise will always burn bright. As long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting."

Jen O'Malley Dillon, chair of Harris' presidential campaign, said in a letter to staff obtained by CBS News that the vice president called Trump to concede the race and pledge that she and Mr. Biden will work to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, "unlike what we saw in 2020."

"I'll leave you with this: losing is unfathomably painful. It is hard. This will take a long time to process," O'Malley Dillon wrote. "But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now. I know the vice president isn't finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission. View this as the beginning, not the end."

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says "you might see a much different Trump" after 2024 presidential election win
Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday morning that President-elect Donald Trump may be "different" in a second term, noting that he now knows the job and won't be seeking reelection.
"So you might see a much different Trump," McCarthy said on "CBS Mornings" when asked about Trump's ability to unite the country as president.
Hours after Trump was projected to win the 2024 presidential race amid a starkly divided electorate, McCarthy urged Democrats that Trump "is not such a hardened person, philosophically, in a hard right position."
"He has positions that are unique, that would go to the middle," McCarthy continued. "People get a Trump syndrome where they just don't even want to work with him, and he'll get his back up, and then if you fight him, he'll fight you. But I think if you go to him, he's probably more willing to go to some certain positions."
McCarthy, a Republican who represented California in the House and was ousted from the speakership in 2023, dismissed concern expressed by officials who worked in Trump's first administration that the president-elect is unfit for office ‚Äî or poses a threat.

McConnell said Republican control of the Senate will help "control the guardrails" of the nation.
"I think one of the most gratifying results of the Senate becoming Republican, the filibuster will stand, there won't be any new states admitted that give a partisan advantage to the other side, and we'll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time" the court makes a decision people don't like, McConnell said.

"This historic election has proven that a majority of Americans are eager for secure borders, lower costs, peace through strength, and a return to common sense," Johnson said in a statement. "As more results come in it is clear that, as we have predicted all along, Republicans are poised to have unified government in the White House, Senate, and House."
The speaker, who currently leads a razor thin majority in the House, touted GOP flips in battleground races, projecting that "when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority, even though we faced a map with 18 Biden-won seats."
Johnson said he looks forward "to working with President Trump and a Republican Senate to deliver as Speaker of the House on the mandate entrusted to us by the American people."

Tim Sheehy ousts Sen. Jon Tester in Montana race, CBS News projects
Tim Sheehy's projected victory over three-term Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is key for Republicans' new GOP majority in the upper chamber. Although Tester fended off previous challenges as a moderate in deep-red Montana, shifting demographics in the state enhanced the pickup opportunity for Republicans.

Tester was among the final Democratic holdouts in the Great Plains, and in red states more broadly.
How Trump won ‚Äî CBS News exit poll results
The voters in the 2024 presidential election were looking for a leader and someone who could bring needed change, and for that change they looked back to former President Donald Trump.

Vice President Kamala Harris underperformed with key parts of the Democratic coalition, while Trump made some inroads. He also continued to excel with some groups who have historically backed him, keeping his coalition largely intact.

CBS News projects a Florida ballot measure will fail that would have enshrined the right to abortion, keeping in place a six-week ban put in place by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Known as Amendment 4, or the "Amendment to Limit Government Interference with Abortion," the measure would have overridden Florida's ban on abortion after six weeks and enshrined abortion rights into the state constitution.

Cait Conley, a senior official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, said Tuesday night that claims by Trump about purported cheating in Philadelphia and Detroit are not true.
"We have seen no evidence, data or reporting to support these claims," Conley said during a briefing with reporters.
She said the agency is not tracking any significant cyber activity against election interference.
"We are not out of the woods yet ‚Ä¶ but we are not currently tracking any significant incidents with national-level impact to election infrastructure or security and that is largely a testament to the professionalism and effort of state and local election officials across the country," Conley said during a briefing with reporters.
The CISA official also said the voting process on Election Day has been "quite peaceful."

Content:Trump lauds latest hostage release, says US will support Israel‚Äôs decision on ceasefire
President Trump on Saturday celebrated the latest hostage release, when Hamas freed the last living Israeli American from captivity in Gaza, but warned the Palestinian militant group that the U.S. will support Israel‚Äôs decision on whether the fragile ceasefire continues.
‚ÄúHamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape!‚Äù Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ‚ÄúThis differs from their statement last week that they would not release any Hostages.‚Äù
‚ÄúIsrael will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O‚ÄôCLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe United States will back the decision they make.‚Äù
Three more hostages were released in Khan Yunis in the latest exchange, including Israeli Argentinian Iair Horn, 46, Israeli American Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, and Russian-Israeli Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov. In return, Israel is set to free 369 Palestinian prisoners, including a number of those who served life sentences.
Saturday‚Äôs release marks the sixth complete exchange since the pause in fighting began on Jan. 19.
Hamas, a designated terrorist organization by the U.S., threatened to delay the release of Israeli hostages earlier this week, and accused the Jewish state of violating the terms of the fragile ceasefire. The group said Monday that the violations were ‚Äúdelaying the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, targeting them with shelling and gunfire in various areas of the Strip, and not allowing the entry of relief supplies in all their forms according to what was agreed upon.‚Äù
Trump then issued a warning to the group, pressing them to release the remaining hostages held in the Strip by noon local time or he would end the brittle ceasefire. He claimed at the time that ‚Äúall hell is going to break out‚Äù if they are not freed.
In line with the U.S. president, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also cautioned the militant group that the temporary truce in Gaza would be shattered and Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which he ordered to amass in and around the war-torn enclave, would restart their fight until Hamas is eviscerated.
‚ÄúThe decision I passed in the Cabinet unanimously is as follows: If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end, and the IDF will resume intense combat until Hamas is decisively defeated,‚Äù Netanyahu said Tuesday.
Hamas did confirm on Thursday that it would go ahead with freeing the three hostages. It is unclear if the rest of the captives held in Gaza will be released later Saturday.
Israel and Hamas are in the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire that is slated to last for six weeks. The terms of the second phase, where more Palestinian prisoners are meant to be freed, have not been brokered entirely.

Content:Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Which phone could win?
Here's how the key specs compare
The Samsung Galaxy S25 has arrived. And the iPhone 16 is here to greet it, as we find out how the two biggest names in flagship phones compare. And while a full Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 face-off will have to wait until we finish reviewing the new Samsung phone, we can at least look at how the features match up based on what's been revealed about the S25.
Samsung will have its hands full taking on the iPhone 16, which has proven to be an excellent ‚Äî and affordable ‚Äî flagship phone. It's also the same cost as the Galaxy S25, making a comparison of the two entry-level flagships ore than apt.
For this comparison, I'm going to focus on the basic Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16, rather than any Pro, Plus or Ultra variants. So let's start digging through the specs and features.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Specs
| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Galaxy S25 | iPhone 16 |
| Starting price | $799 | $799 |

Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Release date and price
The Galaxy S25 debuted at Galaxy Unpacked, with Galaxy S25 preorders now underway. The phone starts at $799 ‚Äî the same price Samsung charged for the Galaxy S24 ‚Äî and it goes on sale February 7.
The iPhone 16 has been out since September 2024, so it's already available from carriers and retailers alike. Like the Galaxy S25, the iPhone 16 costs $799 for its 128GB base model. Upgrading to the 256GB iPhone 16 adds another $100 to the cost, while a 512GB model sells for $1,099.
In contrast, extra storage is much cheaper at Samsung. You can get the 256GB Galaxy S25 for $859, which is just $60 more than the base model.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Design and display
Samsung made only modest changes to the Galaxy S25, keeping the same overall look that its flagships have offered for a while. That said, the new model is shorter and thinner than its predecessor. It's also 0.2 ounces lighter. Despite rumors touting a slight increase in screen size, you still get a 6.2-inch panel with the Galaxy S25.
The iPhone 16 is still a familiar flat-sided device, with its signature Dynamic Island camera/Face ID cutout. However its rear cameras have changed position to mark the iPhone 16 out as new and different (and to enable Spatial Photo and Video recording), an Action Button has appeared to replace the mute slider with a more versatile key, and a new Camera Control has been added to help users adjust camera settings and take photos without using the on-screen buttons.
There's no change in the listed brightness or refresh rate of the Galaxy S25 from last year's model, and that adaptive 120Hz refresh rate gives Samsung an edge over the locked-in 60Hz display Apple continues to use on its entry-level flagship. The Galaxy S25 also boasts a ProScaler feature that turns to AI to improve image accuracy, though we'll have to watch videos on the S25 and iPhone 16 side-by-side to see what impact this feature has.
The iPhone 16's a particularly colorful phone, on offer in Black, White, Pink, Teal and Ultramarine, but Samsung offer its own rainbow of options for the Galaxy S25. You can choose from Navy, Mint, Icy Blue and Silver Shadow from the main options. Order from Samsung, though, and you can pick from three additional colors ‚Äî Blueblack, Coralred and Pinkgold.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Cameras
Samsung made no hardware changes to its Galaxy S25 cameras, instead putting the focus on an upgraded ProVisual Engine for better image processing. We'll see what impact that has after our head-to-head camera testing, but the 50MP main camera, 12MP ultrawide shooter and 10MP telephoto lens are unchanged from what the S24 featured last year as well as what the S23 offered before that.
Still, Samsung enjoys a hardware edge, simply because the iPhone 16 has no dedicated telephoto lens. Instead, the 48MP main camera on Apple's device can crop in on shots to effectively create a 2x zoom. These close-ups look pretty good in our testing, but the Galaxy S25 can offer a 3x optical zoom with its dedicated lens.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Performance
Samsung had some good news at Unpacked, confirming reports that the Galaxy S25 runs on a Snapdragon 8 Elite system-on-chip. And that's not just the S25 models shipping in North America ‚Äî Qualcomm's new silicon features in every S25 model. That's a change from last year when Samsung used Exynos chips in the S24 models released outside of North America.
As we've seen when testing other Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered phones, the new Qualcomm chip delivers very powerful performance. Phones like the OnePlus 13 already post better graphics test results and some better CPU numbers than the A18 chipset found in the iPhone 16.
That said, Apple's phone does post a better score than the OnePlus 13 in the Geekbench single-core test measuring CPU performance. The iPhone 16 also transcodes video in Adobe Premiere Rush much faster than Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered devices in our testing.
Samsung could further mix things up by using an optimized version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite in its phones. It's also worth noting that the Galaxy S25 has more RAM than the iPhone 16 ‚Äî 12GB versus 8GB.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Battery and charging
Samsung didn't change the battery size from the 4,000 mAh power pack that the Galaxy S24 used. Still, we think the Galaxy S25 might improve upon its predecessor's 13.5-hour result in our battery test, based on the strength of the Snapdragon 8 Elite's power management features. Both phones we've tested that use a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset have wound up on our best phone battery life list, so that bodes well for the latest Samsung devices.
While the iPhone 16 is no slouch when it comes to battery life, it doesn't figure to put up much of a fight against the Galaxy S25. In our test, where we have phones surf the web until they run out of power, the iPhone 16 posted a time of 12 hours and 43 minutes. That's more than 2.5 hours better than the average smartphone result, but its 45 minutes shy of the Galaxy S24's time. Any improvement by the Galaxy s25 will widen that gap.
Charging speeds haven't changed for the Galaxy S25, so the 25W wired charging should match what the iPhone 16 offers. Samsung did nominally add Qi2 wireless charging support to its new phone, but you need to buy a separate to take advantage of that capability.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Software and AI features
One UI 7 based on Android 15 makes its debut on the Galaxy S25, and it adds a number of AI-friendly features like writing tools, call transcripts and more. You can summon Google's Gemini with a long press of the S25's side button, and the assistant supports cross app actions, where you can access multiple apps at once. It's all part of the expanded Galaxy AI tools on the S25, which include an Audio Eraser feature for getting distracting sound out of the video you've captured and an updated version of Circle to Search.
Apple has been trying to up its own AI game with Apple Intelligence, which launched as part of the iOS 18.1 update last year. Some of Apple's AI tools are similar to what you get with Galaxy AI ‚Äî including writing tools, summary features, photo-editing and a more advanced Siri. That said, Samsung's updates make its digital assistant far more powerful than what the revamped Siri can currently do.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Outlook
We're in the process of testing out all the new Galaxy S25 features ‚Äî especially cameras, performance and battery life ‚Äî to see what it offers compared with the iPhone 16. Our face-off will also take a closer look at how the different AI tools stack up on each phone.
On paper, it figures to be a very close contest, as all Samsung vs. Apple confrontations tend to be. Check back to see our final Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 verdict.

Content:Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Which phone could win?
Here's how the key specs compare
The Samsung Galaxy S25 has arrived. And the iPhone 16 is here to greet it, as we find out how the two biggest names in flagship phones compare. And while a full Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 face-off will have to wait until we finish reviewing the new Samsung phone, we can at least look at how the features match up based on what's been revealed about the S25.
Samsung will have its hands full taking on the iPhone 16, which has proven to be an excellent ‚Äî and affordable ‚Äî flagship phone. It's also the same cost as the Galaxy S25, making a comparison of the two entry-level flagships ore than apt.
For this comparison, I'm going to focus on the basic Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16, rather than any Pro, Plus or Ultra variants. So let's start digging through the specs and features.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Specs
| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Galaxy S25 | iPhone 16 |
| Starting price | $799 | $799 |
| Display | 6.2-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) | 6.1-inch OLED (2556 x 1179) |
| Refresh rate | 1-120Hz adaptive | 60Hz |
| Processor | Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | A18 |
| RAM | 12GB | 8GB |
| Storage | 128GB, 256GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB |
| Rear cameras | 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom | 48MP main with 2x optical quality zoom, 12MP ultrawide |
| Front camera | 12MP | 12MP |
| Battery size | 4,000 mAh | 3,561 mAh |
| Charging speed | 25W wired, 15W wireless | 25W wired; 15W wireless |
| Size | 5.78 x 2.77 x 0.28 inches | 5.8 x 2.8 x 0.31 inches |
| Weight | 5.71 ounces | 6 ounces |
| Colors | Navy, Icyblue, Mint, and Silver Shadow, Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold | Black, White, Pink, Teal, Ultramarine |
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Release date and price
The Galaxy S25 debuted at Galaxy Unpacked, with Galaxy S25 preorders now underway. The phone starts at $799 ‚Äî the same price Samsung charged for the Galaxy S24 ‚Äî and it goes on sale February 7.
The iPhone 16 has been out since September 2024, so it's already available from carriers and retailers alike. Like the Galaxy S25, the iPhone 16 costs $799 for its 128GB base model. Upgrading to the 256GB iPhone 16 adds another $100 to the cost, while a 512GB model sells for $1,099.
In contrast, extra storage is much cheaper at Samsung. You can get the 256GB Galaxy S25 for $859, which is just $60 more than the base model.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Design and display
Samsung made only modest changes to the Galaxy S25, keeping the same overall look that its flagships have offered for a while. That said, the new model is shorter and thinner than its predecessor. It's also 0.2 ounces lighter. Despite rumors touting a slight increase in screen size, you still get a 6.2-inch panel with the Galaxy S25.
The iPhone 16 is still a familiar flat-sided device, with its signature Dynamic Island camera/Face ID cutout. However its rear cameras have changed position to mark the iPhone 16 out as new and different (and to enable Spatial Photo and Video recording), an Action Button has appeared to replace the mute slider with a more versatile key, and a new Camera Control has been added to help users adjust camera settings and take photos without using the on-screen buttons.
There's no change in the listed brightness or refresh rate of the Galaxy S25 from last year's model, and that adaptive 120Hz refresh rate gives Samsung an edge over the locked-in 60Hz display Apple continues to use on its entry-level flagship. The Galaxy S25 also boasts a ProScaler feature that turns to AI to improve image accuracy, though we'll have to watch videos on the S25 and iPhone 16 side-by-side to see what impact this feature has.
The iPhone 16's a particularly colorful phone, on offer in Black, White, Pink, Teal and Ultramarine, but Samsung offer its own rainbow of options for the Galaxy S25. You can choose from Navy, Mint, Icy Blue and Silver Shadow from the main options. Order from Samsung, though, and you can pick from three additional colors ‚Äî Blueblack, Coralred and Pinkgold.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Cameras
Samsung made no hardware changes to its Galaxy S25 cameras, instead putting the focus on an upgraded ProVisual Engine for better image processing. We'll see what impact that has after our head-to-head camera testing, but the 50MP main camera, 12MP ultrawide shooter and 10MP telephoto lens are unchanged from what the S24 featured last year as well as what the S23 offered before that.
Still, Samsung enjoys a hardware edge, simply because the iPhone 16 has no dedicated telephoto lens. Instead, the 48MP main camera on Apple's device can crop in on shots to effectively create a 2x zoom. These close-ups look pretty good in our testing, but the Galaxy S25 can offer a 3x optical zoom with its dedicated lens.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Performance
Samsung had some good news at Unpacked, confirming reports that the Galaxy S25 runs on a Snapdragon 8 Elite system-on-chip. And that's not just the S25 models shipping in North America ‚Äî Qualcomm's new silicon features in every S25 model. That's a change from last year when Samsung used Exynos chips in the S24 models released outside of North America.
As we've seen when testing other Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered phones, the new Qualcomm chip delivers very powerful performance. Phones like the OnePlus 13 already post better graphics test results and some better CPU numbers than the A18 chipset found in the iPhone 16.
That said, Apple's phone does post a better score than the OnePlus 13 in the Geekbench single-core test measuring CPU performance. The iPhone 16 also transcodes video in Adobe Premiere Rush much faster than Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered devices in our testing.
Samsung could further mix things up by using an optimized version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite in its phones. It's also worth noting that the Galaxy S25 has more RAM than the iPhone 16 ‚Äî 12GB versus 8GB.

Still, we think the Galaxy S25 might improve upon its predecessor's 13.5-hour result in our battery test, based on the strength of the Snapdragon 8 Elite's power management features. Both phones we've tested that use a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset have wound up on our best phone battery life list, so that bodes well for the latest Samsung devices.

In our test, where we have phones surf the web until they run out of power, the iPhone 16 posted a time of 12 hours and 43 minutes. That's more than 2.5 hours better than the average smartphone result, but its 45 minutes shy of the Galaxy S24's time. Any improvement by the Galaxy s25 will widen that gap.
Charging speeds haven't changed for the Galaxy S25, so the 25W wired charging should match what the iPhone 16 offers. Samsung did nominally add Qi2 wireless charging support to its new phone, but you need to buy a separate to take advantage of that capability.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Software and AI features
One UI 7 based on Android 15 makes its debut on the Galaxy S25, and it adds a number of AI-friendly features like writing tools, call transcripts and more. You can summon Google's Gemini with a long press of the S25's side button, and the assistant supports cross app actions, where you can access multiple apps at once. It's all part of the expanded Galaxy AI tools on the S25, which include an Audio Eraser feature for getting distracting sound out of the video you've captured and an updated version of Circle to Search.
Apple has been trying to up its own AI game with Apple Intelligence, which launched as part of the iOS 18.1 update last year. Some of Apple's AI tools are similar to what you get with Galaxy AI ‚Äî including writing tools, summary features, photo-editing and a more advanced Siri. That said, Samsung's updates make its digital assistant far more powerful than what the revamped Siri can currently do.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Outlook
We're in the process of testing out all the new Galaxy S25 features ‚Äî especially cameras, performance and battery life ‚Äî to see what it offers compared with the iPhone 16. Our face-off will also take a closer look at how the different AI tools stack up on each phone.
On paper, it figures to be a very close contest, as all Samsung vs. Apple confrontations tend to be. Check back to see our final Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 verdict.

Content:Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Which phone could win?
Here's how the key specs compare
The Samsung Galaxy S25 has arrived. And the iPhone 16 is here to greet it, as we find out how the two biggest names in flagship phones compare. And while a full Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 face-off will have to wait until we finish reviewing the new Samsung phone, we can at least look at how the features match up based on what's been revealed about the S25.
Samsung will have its hands full taking on the iPhone 16, which has proven to be an excellent ‚Äî and affordable ‚Äî flagship phone. It's also the same cost as the Galaxy S25, making a comparison of the two entry-level flagships ore than apt.
For this comparison, I'm going to focus on the basic Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16, rather than any Pro, Plus or Ultra variants. So let's start digging through the specs and features.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Specs
| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Galaxy S25 | iPhone 16 |
| Starting price | $799 | $799 |
| Display | 6.2-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) | 6.1-inch OLED (2556 x 1179) |
| Refresh rate | 1-120Hz adaptive | 60Hz |
| Processor | Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | A18 |
| RAM | 12GB | 8GB |
| Storage | 128GB, 256GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB |
| Rear cameras | 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom | 48MP main with 2x optical quality zoom, 12MP ultrawide |
| Front camera | 12MP | 12MP |
| Battery size | 4,000 mAh | 3,561 mAh |
| Charging speed | 25W wired, 15W wireless | 25W wired; 15W wireless |
| Size | 5.78 x 2.77 x 0.28 inches | 5.8 x 2.8 x 0.31 inches |
| Weight | 5.71 ounces | 6 ounces |
| Colors | Navy, Icyblue, Mint, and Silver Shadow, Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold | Black, White, Pink, Teal, Ultramarine |
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Release date and price
The Galaxy S25 debuted at Galaxy Unpacked, with Galaxy S25 preorders now underway. The phone starts at $799 ‚Äî the same price Samsung charged for the Galaxy S24 ‚Äî and it goes on sale February 7.
The iPhone 16 has been out since September 2024, so it's already available from carriers and retailers alike. Like the Galaxy S25, the iPhone 16 costs $799 for its 128GB base model. Upgrading to the 256GB iPhone 16 adds another $100 to the cost, while a 512GB model sells for $1,099.
In contrast, extra storage is much cheaper at Samsung. You can get the 256GB Galaxy S25 for $859, which is just $60 more than the base model.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Design and display
Samsung made only modest changes to the Galaxy S25, keeping the same overall look that its flagships have offered for a while. That said, the new model is shorter and thinner than its predecessor. It's also 0.2 ounces lighter. Despite rumors touting a slight increase in screen size, you still get a 6.2-inch panel with the Galaxy S25.
The iPhone 16 is still a familiar flat-sided device, with its signature Dynamic Island camera/Face ID cutout. However its rear cameras have changed position to mark the iPhone 16 out as new and different (and to enable Spatial Photo and Video recording), an Action Button has appeared to replace the mute slider with a more versatile key, and a new Camera Control has been added to help users adjust camera settings and take photos without using the on-screen buttons.
There's no change in the listed brightness or refresh rate of the Galaxy S25 from last year's model, and that adaptive 120Hz refresh rate gives Samsung an edge over the locked-in 60Hz display Apple continues to use on its entry-level flagship. The Galaxy S25 also boasts a ProScaler feature that turns to AI to improve image accuracy, though we'll have to watch videos on the S25 and iPhone 16 side-by-side to see what impact this feature has.
The iPhone 16's a particularly colorful phone, on offer in Black, White, Pink, Teal and Ultramarine, but Samsung offer its own rainbow of options for the Galaxy S25. You can choose from Navy, Mint, Icy Blue and Silver Shadow from the main options. Order from Samsung, though, and you can pick from three additional colors ‚Äî Blueblack, Coralred and Pinkgold.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Cameras
Samsung made no hardware changes to its Galaxy S25 cameras, instead putting the focus on an upgraded ProVisual Engine for better image processing. We'll see what impact that has after our head-to-head camera testing, but the 50MP main camera, 12MP ultrawide shooter and 10MP telephoto lens are unchanged from what the S24 featured last year as well as what the S23 offered before that.
Still, Samsung enjoys a hardware edge, simply because the iPhone 16 has no dedicated telephoto lens. Instead, the 48MP main camera on Apple's device can crop in on shots to effectively create a 2x zoom. These close-ups look pretty good in our testing, but the Galaxy S25 can offer a 3x optical zoom with its dedicated lens.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Performance
Samsung had some good news at Unpacked, confirming reports that the Galaxy S25 runs on a Snapdragon 8 Elite system-on-chip. And that's not just the S25 models shipping in North America ‚Äî Qualcomm's new silicon features in every S25 model. That's a change from last year when Samsung used Exynos chips in the S24 models released outside of North America.
As we've seen when testing other Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered phones, the new Qualcomm chip delivers very powerful performance. Phones like the OnePlus 13 already post better graphics test results and some better CPU numbers than the A18 chipset found in the iPhone 16.
That said, Apple's phone does post a better score than the OnePlus 13 in the Geekbench single-core test measuring CPU performance. The iPhone 16 also transcodes video in Adobe Premiere Rush much faster than Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered devices in our testing.
Samsung could further mix things up by using an optimized version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite in its phones. It's also worth noting that the Galaxy S25 has more RAM than the iPhone 16 ‚Äî 12GB versus 8GB.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Battery and charging
Samsung didn't change the battery size from the 4,000 mAh power pack that the Galaxy S24 used. Still, we think the Galaxy S25 might improve upon its predecessor's 13.5-hour result in our battery test, based on the strength of the Snapdragon 8 Elite's power management features. Both phones we've tested that use a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset have wound up on our best phone battery life list, so that bodes well for the latest Samsung devices.
While the iPhone 16 is no slouch when it comes to battery life, it doesn't figure to put up much of a fight against the Galaxy S25. In our test, where we have phones surf the web until they run out of power, the iPhone 16 posted a time of 12 hours and 43 minutes. That's more than 2.5 hours better than the average smartphone result, but its 45 minutes shy of the Galaxy S24's time. Any improvement by the Galaxy s25 will widen that gap.
Charging speeds haven't changed for the Galaxy S25, so the 25W wired charging should match what the iPhone 16 offers. Samsung did nominally add Qi2 wireless charging support to its new phone, but you need to buy a separate to take advantage of that capability.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Software and AI features
One UI 7 based on Android 15 makes its debut on the Galaxy S25, and it adds a number of AI-friendly features like writing tools, call transcripts and more. You can summon Google's Gemini with a long press of the S25's side button, and the assistant supports cross app actions, where you can access multiple apps at once. It's all part of the expanded Galaxy AI tools on the S25, which include an Audio Eraser feature for getting distracting sound out of the video you've captured and an updated version of Circle to Search.
Apple has been trying to up its own AI game with Apple Intelligence, which launched as part of the iOS 18.1 update last year. Some of Apple's AI tools are similar to what you get with Galaxy AI ‚Äî including writing tools, summary features, photo-editing and a more advanced Siri. That said, Samsung's updates make its digital assistant far more powerful than what the revamped Siri can currently do.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Outlook
We're in the process of testing out all the new Galaxy S25 features ‚Äî especially cameras, performance and battery life ‚Äî to see what it offers compared with the iPhone 16. Our face-off will also take a closer look at how the different AI tools stack up on each phone.
On paper, it figures to be a very close contest, as all Samsung vs. Apple confrontations tend to be. Check back to see our final Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 verdict.

Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: I compared the base models that most people should buy
Samsung just launched its new lineup of flagship Galaxy smartphones at its Unpacked event, and they're packed with AI features, additional integrations, and a powerful, energy-efficient processor. This year's Galaxy S25 base model comes with a 6.2-inch FHD+ AMOLED display, 12GB of memory, and a 50MP main camera, all of which go head-to-head with the other big smartphone on the market right now: the iPhone 16.

Both devices have their own set of pros and cons, so if you can't decide which way you want to go, we don't blame you. We've broken down some of the standout feature sets from both phones to compare how they differ, highlighting the specs and use cases so you can choose the right device for your needs.
If neither of these phones does it for you, Samsung also released an S25+ and S25 Ultra version, which feature bigger displays, better cameras, more battery power, and of course, more storage. But let's start by comparing the S25 with Apple's base model iPhone 16.

You should buy the Samsung Galaxy S25 if...
1. You want one of the fastest smartphone right now
The iPhone 16's Apple A18 processor is undoubtedly fast, but the Galaxy S25's Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is one of the fastest on the market. In fact, Samsung says the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is the most powerful processor ever placed in a Galaxy phone, with a 40% performance increase to the NPU, 37% increase to the CPU, and 30% to the GPU compared to the Galaxy S24.
The Snapdragon 8 Elite chip was designed specifically for the Galaxy S25. It has two primary cores and six performance cores, providing a higher baseline performance while also being more energy efficient. The jump-up in performance also applies to mobile gaming, with improved ray tracing and a 40% larger vapor chamber to keep things running cool.
Also: I went hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy S25 - and the AI features were surprisingly polished
All in all, this chip allows for more efficient multitasking, while the customized architecture brings more power to the camera, the visuals, and processing speeds, especially for AI tasks. Paired with the 12GB of RAM compared to the iPhone 16's 8GB should result in a blazing-fast user experience.
2. You want fully-integrated AI (that actually works)
Samsung didn't want to just throw an AI assistant in with the S25's app selection, it wanted to make the phone a true AI companion with a contextual understanding of users' needs. Even better: Galaxy S25 buyers receive a six-month subscription to Gemini Advanced for free, a service that is normally $20/month.
The S25's multimodal AI agents can interpret speech, video, and images for natural, context-aware interactions without the need to prompt or tee it up. The multimodal AI automatically recognizes what's on the screen, be it phone numbers, emails, or website URLs.

Also, the Now Brief feature utilizes AI to provide a summary of your day based on data found in the calendar, Samsung Health, and a host of other apps. For example, if your health app recorded poor sleep the night before, it might suggest you take it easy or postpone a tough planned workout for the following day.
The AI takes it a step further by attempting to predict user behavior, for example, automatically switching to the corresponding app when you share a GIF or opening the calendar if you save time and date details. Pressing and holding the side button activates Gemini, which is streamlined across your Google and Samsung devices and even the third-party apps that they're associated.
By contrast, the Apple Intelligence features loaded on the iPhone 16 have received lukewarm reviews with many of the features still in development or not fully rolled out to their final versions.
3. You own other Samsung devices
Integration between other devices in Samsung's ecosystem remains one of the company's foremost goals, and the Galaxy S25 comes with some new features to further improve seamless integration between devices. You can make the argument that Samsung took a page or two out of Apple's book for this but with improved functionality.
Also: The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge was sneakily the best announcement at Unpacked 2025
The Now Bar is a new feature on the Galaxy S25 and is Samsung's take on Live Activities. The Now Bar aims to be more intuitive, however, displaying different apps or devices as stacked cards on the lock screen that can be swiped through and paused/played in real-time.
If you have a Samsung Galaxy Book laptop, you can remote into your phone and vice versa with Samsung Flow to share files, images, and videos seamlessly, while multi-control lets you share Bluetooth devices like keyboards and mice between different Galaxy devices. Essentially, Samsung's goal here is to make all of your Galaxy devices work and deliver a single streamlined experience.
You should buy the iPhone 16 if...
1. You're comfortable in Apple's ecosystem
This is a no-brainer. Apple has gone to great lengths to create the seamless ecosystem that exists across its products, and its something that Samsung is only now coming to replicate. If you have other Apple devices such as a MacBook, iMac, or iPad, you have established ways of working between these devices, and switching to an Android-based Galaxy S25 now could be a big process.
Apple's "walled garden" has, for better or for worse, become a comfortable, familiar place for millions of users, and there's something to be said about sticking with the device that you know how to use. If you know the iPhone 16 will be compatible with your AirPods, Apple Watch, and the myriad of apps that those products are tied to, you might be forced to stick with the iPhone.
Also: Forget the Ray-Ban Metas: Samsung's upcoming smart glasses are the wearables I've been waiting for
Being fully immersed in the Apple ecosystem means you'd have to actively want to uproot yourself in order to switch to a Samsung device. You'll have to re-learn to navigate the Android OS, potentially transfer over huge amounts of files or photos, and swap all your apps to an Android format. If you are getting anxious just reading this, you might be better off sticking with your Apple device for now.
2. You're an emoji aficionado
Apple Intelligence may have taken a bit longer to get up and running, but some of the AI features that rolled out recently for the iPhone 16 may have been worth the wait. Take the new Genmoji feature, which went live with iOS update 18.2, and allows users to generate their emojis using text prompts.
The emojis can then be sent as stickers, used inline with text messages, or even added to Tapback reactions, sprucing up Apple's messaging ecosystem with more customizability. With additional text effects also going live (usable by additional iPhone models), if you're a texter who's glued to iMessage for all your communication, Apple still does it the best.

Content:Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Which phone could win?
Here's how the key specs compare
The Samsung Galaxy S25 has arrived. And the iPhone 16 is here to greet it, as we find out how the two biggest names in flagship phones compare. And while a full Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 face-off will have to wait until we finish reviewing the new Samsung phone, we can at least look at how the features match up based on what's been revealed about the S25.
Samsung will have its hands full taking on the iPhone 16, which has proven to be an excellent ‚Äî and affordable ‚Äî flagship phone. It's also the same cost as the Galaxy S25, making a comparison of the two entry-level flagships ore than apt.
For this comparison, I'm going to focus on the basic Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16, rather than any Pro, Plus or Ultra variants. So let's start digging through the specs and features.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Specs
| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Galaxy S25 | iPhone 16 |
| Starting price | $799 | $799 |
| Display | 6.2-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) | 6.1-inch OLED (2556 x 1179) |

| Weight | 5.71 ounces | 6 ounces |
| Colors | Navy, Icyblue, Mint, and Silver Shadow, Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold | Black, White, Pink, Teal, Ultramarine |
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Release date and price
The Galaxy S25 debuted at Galaxy Unpacked, with Galaxy S25 preorders now underway. The phone starts at $799 ‚Äî the same price Samsung charged for the Galaxy S24 ‚Äî and it goes on sale February 7.
The iPhone 16 has been out since September 2024, so it's already available from carriers and retailers alike. Like the Galaxy S25, the iPhone 16 costs $799 for its 128GB base model. Upgrading to the 256GB iPhone 16 adds another $100 to the cost, while a 512GB model sells for $1,099.
In contrast, extra storage is much cheaper at Samsung. You can get the 256GB Galaxy S25 for $859, which is just $60 more than the base model.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Design and display
Samsung made only modest changes to the Galaxy S25, keeping the same overall look that its flagships have offered for a while. That said, the new model is shorter and thinner than its predecessor. It's also 0.2 ounces lighter. Despite rumors touting a slight increase in screen size, you still get a 6.2-inch panel with the Galaxy S25.
The iPhone 16 is still a familiar flat-sided device, with its signature Dynamic Island camera/Face ID cutout. However its rear cameras have changed position to mark the iPhone 16 out as new and different (and to enable Spatial Photo and Video recording), an Action Button has appeared to replace the mute slider with a more versatile key, and a new Camera Control has been added to help users adjust camera settings and take photos without using the on-screen buttons.
There's no change in the listed brightness or refresh rate of the Galaxy S25 from last year's model, and that adaptive 120Hz refresh rate gives Samsung an edge over the locked-in 60Hz display Apple continues to use on its entry-level flagship. The Galaxy S25 also boasts a ProScaler feature that turns to AI to improve image accuracy, though we'll have to watch videos on the S25 and iPhone 16 side-by-side to see what impact this feature has.
The iPhone 16's a particularly colorful phone, on offer in Black, White, Pink, Teal and Ultramarine, but Samsung offer its own rainbow of options for the Galaxy S25. You can choose from Navy, Mint, Icy Blue and Silver Shadow from the main options. Order from Samsung, though, and you can pick from three additional colors ‚Äî Blueblack, Coralred and Pinkgold.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Cameras
Samsung made no hardware changes to its Galaxy S25 cameras, instead putting the focus on an upgraded ProVisual Engine for better image processing. We'll see what impact that has after our head-to-head camera testing, but the 50MP main camera, 12MP ultrawide shooter and 10MP telephoto lens are unchanged from what the S24 featured last year as well as what the S23 offered before that.
Still, Samsung enjoys a hardware edge, simply because the iPhone 16 has no dedicated telephoto lens. Instead, the 48MP main camera on Apple's device can crop in on shots to effectively create a 2x zoom. These close-ups look pretty good in our testing, but the Galaxy S25 can offer a 3x optical zoom with its dedicated lens.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Performance
Samsung had some good news at Unpacked, confirming reports that the Galaxy S25 runs on a Snapdragon 8 Elite system-on-chip. And that's not just the S25 models shipping in North America ‚Äî Qualcomm's new silicon features in every S25 model. That's a change from last year when Samsung used Exynos chips in the S24 models released outside of North America.
As we've seen when testing other Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered phones, the new Qualcomm chip delivers very powerful performance. Phones like the OnePlus 13 already post better graphics test results and some better CPU numbers than the A18 chipset found in the iPhone 16.
That said, Apple's phone does post a better score than the OnePlus 13 in the Geekbench single-core test measuring CPU performance. The iPhone 16 also transcodes video in Adobe Premiere Rush much faster than Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered devices in our testing.
Samsung could further mix things up by using an optimized version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite in its phones. It's also worth noting that the Galaxy S25 has more RAM than the iPhone 16 ‚Äî 12GB versus 8GB.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Battery and charging
Samsung didn't change the battery size from the 4,000 mAh power pack that the Galaxy S24 used. Still, we think the Galaxy S25 might improve upon its predecessor's 13.5-hour result in our battery test, based on the strength of the Snapdragon 8 Elite's power management features. Both phones we've tested that use a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset have wound up on our best phone battery life list, so that bodes well for the latest Samsung devices.
While the iPhone 16 is no slouch when it comes to battery life, it doesn't figure to put up much of a fight against the Galaxy S25. In our test, where we have phones surf the web until they run out of power, the iPhone 16 posted a time of 12 hours and 43 minutes. That's more than 2.5 hours better than the average smartphone result, but its 45 minutes shy of the Galaxy S24's time. Any improvement by the Galaxy s25 will widen that gap.
Charging speeds haven't changed for the Galaxy S25, so the 25W wired charging should match what the iPhone 16 offers. Samsung did nominally add Qi2 wireless charging support to its new phone, but you need to buy a separate to take advantage of that capability.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Software and AI features
One UI 7 based on Android 15 makes its debut on the Galaxy S25, and it adds a number of AI-friendly features like writing tools, call transcripts and more. You can summon Google's Gemini with a long press of the S25's side button, and the assistant supports cross app actions, where you can access multiple apps at once. It's all part of the expanded Galaxy AI tools on the S25, which include an Audio Eraser feature for getting distracting sound out of the video you've captured and an updated version of Circle to Search.
Apple has been trying to up its own AI game with Apple Intelligence, which launched as part of the iOS 18.1 update last year. Some of Apple's AI tools are similar to what you get with Galaxy AI ‚Äî including writing tools, summary features, photo-editing and a more advanced Siri. That said, Samsung's updates make its digital assistant far more powerful than what the revamped Siri can currently do.
Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Outlook
We're in the process of testing out all the new Galaxy S25 features ‚Äî especially cameras, performance and battery life ‚Äî to see what it offers compared with the iPhone 16. Our face-off will also take a closer look at how the different AI tools stack up on each phone.
On paper, it figures to be a very close contest, as all Samsung vs. Apple confrontations tend to be. Check back to see our final Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 verdict.
